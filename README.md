# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The task is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Overview

### The challenge

## User Story (given)

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Inquirer
- Mysql/Mysql2
- Console.table
- Database
- 

### What I learned

I learned a ton about how to use database data, manipulate the data, call certain data -- this was a really big challenge for me and I feel very accomplished with what I learned!! 


### Continued development

In order to continue development of this project it would be fun to build a front end where all the information could be displayed on a browser and manipulated from there rather than just from the terminal.
